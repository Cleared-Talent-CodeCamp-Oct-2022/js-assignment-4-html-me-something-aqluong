      <div id="testP">
         <p class="funParagraph">One day I was taking Oliver to the dog park and there is this man made lake that is
            generally used by the dogs to go swimming.
            Although Oliver was told not to go many times he bolted to that lake dispite my orders of not
            going there. There was a instance where he looked at me and I looked him.
            We both had a mental conversation where he knew I didn't want him going into the lake and me knowing that he
            was going to do what he wanted.
            He ended up having to take a unscheduled bath that he typically does not enjoy for whatever reasons.
