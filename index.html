   <div id="testP">
      <p class="funParagraph">One day I was taking Oliver to the Dog park and there is this man made lake that is
         generally used by the dogs to
         go swimming. Although Oliver was told not to go many times he bolted to that lake dispite my orders of not
         going
         there. He ennded up having to take a unscheduled bath that he typically does not enjoy for whatever reasons.
